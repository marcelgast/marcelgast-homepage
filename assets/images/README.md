# Image Storage

Store all static site images here so they are served directly by GitHub Pages.

Suggested folders:

- `assets/images/about/`
- `assets/images/music/`
- `assets/images/projects/`
- `assets/images/practicetab/`
- `assets/images/logos/`
- `assets/images/misc/`

Use absolute paths in your pages, for example:

```html
<img class="img-fluid" src="/assets/images/projects/xerador-cover.jpg" alt="Xerador cover">
```
