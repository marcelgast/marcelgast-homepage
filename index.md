    <h2 class="section-title">Hi There!</h2>
    <div class="about-grid">
      <p class="lead">
        I'm Marcel. I’m a guitarist and metal musician with a deep love for guitars, gear, and experimenting with sound.
        <br><br>
        Music has always been more than just playing songs for me — I enjoy digging into tone, setups, and finding my own sound. Over the years, this naturally led to several projects. Xerador is my main band, where most of my creative energy goes. Alongside that, Katalyst is my solo project, and Frostfire Wings is a collaboration with a close friend and vocalist, exploring a different musical direction.
        <br><br>
        Outside of music, I’m also a software developer. I started working on PracticeTab because practicing guitar often frustrated me — I lost focus, jumped between exercises, and spent more time organizing and editing than actually playing. PracticeTab is my attempt to solve that problem by creating a focused, distraction-free practice environment.
        <br><br>
        In addition to that, I also build custom websites for musicians, bands, and small projects. If you’re interested in a tailored website or a technical collaboration, feel free to reach out.
        <br><br>
        I care about quality, details, and strong visual direction while still keeping everything easy to use and maintain.

          <h3>Xerador</h3>
          <p>Xerador is my main groove metal project. I joined the band in 2024, where I play guitar and actively contribute to the songwriting process.
          <br><br>
          The band is built around collaboration. All five of us are involved in shaping the music — from riffs and rhythms to overall song structure and atmosphere. The goal has never been to chase trends or formulas, but to create heavy, honest music that we genuinely enjoy listening to ourselves.

          <h3>Katalyst</h3>
          <p>Katalyst is my solo project, where every aspect of the music is created by me. From writing and recording to mixing and production, everything is handled independently.
          <br><br>
          For this project, I also stepped into vocals — something I specifically learned in order to fully express the ideas behind the music. Every riff, every note, and every decision is intentional and authentic, without compromise or external influence.

          <h3>Frostfire Wings</h3>
          <p>Frostfire Wings is a project I created together with a close friend and vocalist. It exists outside the boundaries of my other musical projects and allows us to explore ideas that don’t naturally fit into those genres.
          <br><br>
          The focus is on experimentation and combining different styles, blending influences, and shaping something new without predefined rules. Frostfire Wings is driven by curiosity and collaboration, giving us the freedom to follow ideas wherever they lead and develop a sound that stands on its own.

          <h3>PracticeTab</h3>
          <p>
            PracticeTab is a focus-first practice tool for guitar. It’s designed to remove distractions and help you stay locked in on what actually matters: practicing.
            <br><br>
            Instead of juggling tabs, metronomes, notes, and timers across different tools, PracticeTab brings everything into one focused environment. The goal is simple — less friction, more consistency, and practice sessions that actually feel productive.

    <h2 class="section-title">Custom Websites</h2>
    <p class="lead">
      I build modern, custom websites on request, tailored to the needs of each project. I especially enjoy working with bands, artists, and creative projects, but I also build websites for more traditional businesses.
      <br><br>
      My focus is on clean structure, clear user experience, and strong visual identity. I prefer modern designs with thoughtful layouts and intentional use of color, making sure the site not only looks good but also feels easy and natural to use.
      <br><br>
      Every website is built with a specific purpose in mind — whether it’s presenting music, promoting a project, or supporting a business — and is shaped around the people who will actually use it.

    <h2 class="section-title">Spotify Playlists</h2>
    <p class="lead">
    There’s hardly a better way to get to know someone than through the music they listen to, so I’m sharing my two most-played playlists.
    <br><br>
    Favorites is a collection of music I’ve enjoyed since I started using Spotify — essentially a soundtrack of my life, shaped over time by different phases, moods, and discoveries.
    <br><br>
    Hair Metal exists because I genuinely love the 80s. Not for the sometimes corny lyrics, but for the outstanding guitar work and the sense of fun that defined that era. The songs are energetic, expressive, and unapologetically enjoyable — and that’s exactly why they’re here.
